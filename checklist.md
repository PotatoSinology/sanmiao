To prepare your Python script that accesses CSVs in a folder for publication on GitHub and PyPI, you need to structure your project as a proper Python package, include necessary configuration files, and set up a workflow for distribution. Since your script likely involves date conversion logic (based on our previous conversation) and processes CSV files, I’ll assume it’s a module with reusable functionality. Below, I’ll outline the steps and provide the necessary files to make it installable via `pip` and shareable on GitHub. I’ll use **TimeWeave** as the package name (since you liked it and it’s available on PyPI) and include a `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging, an `__init__.py` for the package, and other essential files.

### Steps to Prepare Your Package
1. **Organize Your Project Structure**: Create a clear directory structure to make your package modular and PyPI-ready.
2. **Create Configuration Files**: Include `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and optionally `MANIFEST.in` for non-Python files like CSVs.
3. **Add Versioning**: Define the package version in `__init__.py` or dynamically via `pyproject.toml`.
4. **Write Documentation**: Provide a `README.md` to explain installation and usage.
5. **Set Up GitHub**: Initialize a Git repository and push to GitHub.
6. **Prepare for PyPI**: Use tools like `build` and `twine` for packaging and uploading.
7. **Optional Automation**: Set up a GitHub Actions workflow for automatic PyPI publishing.

### Project Structure
Here’s the recommended structure for your project, assuming your script is called `csv_date_converter.py` and handles date conversions:

```
timeweave/
├── src/
│   └── timeweave/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── csv_date_converter.py
├── tests/
│   └── test_csv_date_converter.py
├── data/
│   └── sample.csv
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
└── .gitignore
```

- **`src/timeweave/`**: Contains your package’s source code.
- **`tests/`**: Placeholder for unit tests (optional but recommended for developers).
- **`data/`**: Optional folder for sample CSVs (not included in PyPI distribution).
- **`LICENSE`**: Specifies the license (e.g., MIT).
- **`README.md`**: Describes your package for users.
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Configures package metadata and build system.
- **`.gitignore`**: Excludes unnecessary files from Git.

### Required Files

Below are the key files you need, wrapped in ````` tags as requested. I’ll assume your script processes CSVs with date conversion logic (e.g., converting between Western, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and a custom “laker” calendar). Adjust the details (e.g., dependencies, descriptions) as needed.

**Notes on `pyproject.toml`:**
- Uses `setuptools` as the build backend (standard for PyPI).
- Lists dependencies (`cnlunar` for Chinese/Korean lunar calendars, `pandas` for CSV processing).
- Includes metadata like name, version, and classifiers for PyPI discoverability.
- Links to GitHub and documentation (update `your-username` to your GitHub username).
- The `src` layout is recommended for cleaner packaging.[](https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/)

```python
__version__ = "0.1.0"

from .csv_date_converter import DateConverter  # Adjust based on your main class/function
```

**Notes on `__init__.py`:**
- Marks the `timeweave` directory as a Python package.
- Defines the package version (must match `pyproject.toml` unless using dynamic versioning).
- Imports your main class/function (e.g., `DateConverter`) for easy access (e.g., `from timeweave import DateConverter`).

exclude data/*.csv


**Notes on `MANIFEST.in`:**
- Ensures `README.md` and `LICENSE` are included in the PyPI package.
- Excludes `data/*.csv` to prevent sample CSVs from being distributed (remove this line if you want CSVs in the package).

### Additional Steps

#### 1. Update Your Script
Ensure your `csv_date_converter.py` is modular and reusable. For example:
- Move your `DateConverter` class (from our previous conversation) to `src/timeweave/csv_date_converter.py`.
- Add CSV processing logic using `pandas`. Example:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  from .date_converter import DateConverter  # Assuming you reuse the DateConverter class

  def process_csv(input_path, output_path, date_column):
      df = pd.read_csv(input_path)
      converter = DateConverter()
      df[f"{date_column}_chinese"] = df[date_column].apply(lambda x: converter.gregorian_to_chinese(pd.to_datetime(x)))
      df.to_csv(output_path, index=False)
  ```
- Update `__init__.py` to expose key functions or classes.

#### 2. Test Your Package Locally
- Create a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- Install dependencies and build tools:
  ```bash
  pip install setuptools wheel build twine
  ```
- Build the package:
  ```bash
  python -m build
  ```
  This creates `dist/` with a `.whl` and `.tar.gz` file.
- Install locally to test:
  ```bash
  pip install dist/timeweave-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
  ```
- Test your script:
  ```python
  from timeweave import DateConverter
  # Your test code here
  ```

#### 3. Set Up GitHub
- Initialize a Git repository:
  ```bash
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```
- Create a repository on GitHub (e.g., `your-username/timeweave`).
- Push to GitHub:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/timeweave.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  ```

#### 4. Publish to PyPI
- **Create a PyPI Account**: Register at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/).
- **Test on TestPyPI**:
  ```bash
  twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
  ```
  Use your TestPyPI credentials when prompted.
- **Verify Installation**:
  ```bash
  pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ TimeWeave
  ```
- **Upload to PyPI**:
  ```bash
  twine upload dist/*
  ```
  Use your PyPI credentials. Alternatively, set up trusted publishing with GitHub Actions (see below).[](https://medium.com/%40blackary/publishing-a-python-package-from-github-to-pypi-in-2024-a6fb8635d45d)

#### 5. Optional: Automate with GitHub Actions
To automate publishing to PyPI when you create a release, add a GitHub Actions workflow.

```yaml
name: Publish to PyPI

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write  # Required for trusted publishing
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.x"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install build
      - name: Build package
        run: python -m build
      - name: Publish to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
        with:
          repository-url: https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
```

**Notes on GitHub Actions:**
- Triggers on a GitHub release (create one via the GitHub UI with a tag like `v0.1.0`).
- Uses trusted publishing, so set up an API token in PyPI under “Account Settings > Publishing.”[](https://www.paigeniedringhaus.com/blog/automatically-publish-a-repo-as-a-py-pi-library-with-git-hub-actions/)
- Ensure the package name in `pyproject.toml` matches your PyPI project name.

#### 6. Add Tests (Optional)
Create a test file in `tests/test_csv_date_converter.py` to ensure your code works. Example:
```python
import unittest
from timeweave import DateConverter
import datetime

class TestDateConverter(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_gregorian_to_chinese(self):
        converter = DateConverter()
        result = converter.gregorian_to_chinese(datetime.date(2025, 8, 2))
        self.assertIsInstance(result, dict)
        self.assertIn("lunar_year", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
Run tests with:
```bash
pip install pytest
pytest tests/
```

### Final Checklist
- [ ] Verify `pyproject.toml` has correct metadata (name, version, dependencies).
- [ ] Ensure `README.md` is clear and includes usage examples.
- [ ] Choose a license and include it in `LICENSE`.
- [ ] Test the package locally (`python -m build` and `pip install`).
- [ ] Push to GitHub and verify the repository structure.
- [ ] Test on TestPyPI before uploading to PyPI.
- [ ] Optionally set up GitHub Actions for automated publishing.

### Notes
- **CSV Files**: If your CSVs are sample data, exclude them from the PyPI package (as in `MANIFEST.in`) but include them in the GitHub repo for examples. If they’re required for functionality, include them via `MANIFEST.in` and adjust `csv_date_converter.py` to access them using `importlib.resources`.[](https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/)
- **Dependencies**: I included `cnlunar` and `pandas` based on your script’s likely needs. Update `dependencies` in `pyproject.toml` if you use others.
- **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning (e.g., `0.1.0` for initial release). Update `__version__` and `pyproject.toml` for each release.[](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python_packaging/instructor/05-publishing.html)
- **Documentation**: Consider hosting detailed docs on Read the Docs (linked in `pyproject.toml`).[](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/tutorials/pyproject-toml.html)

If you need help with specific parts (e.g., handling CSVs with `importlib.resources`, writing tests, or setting up Read the Docs), let me know!
